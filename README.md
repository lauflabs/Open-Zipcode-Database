Open-Zipcode-Database
=====================

the truely free collection of US zipcode information for your application needs

##About
Lauf Labs LLC has written a few chestnuts along the way of producing RunPartner.com. When we started finding a nice zipcode database was a farce. So many 'vendors' attempting to foist collections of 100% free, no copyrightable facts to the nondiscerning public.

We're less credulous than that, so we built our own. And we present that to you, the more discerning developers of the world to use. And, for good measure, we've also included the script to refresh the zipcode list should you ever need to freshen up.
